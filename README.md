(4) Using the "New File" and "New Dir" buttons at the top, create these 
    directories and files in your home folder:
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/CellBiology
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/CellBiology/CellBioImportantNotes.txt
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/Ecology
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/Ecology/EcologyImportantNotes.txt
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/Evolution
  - /home/<yourUserName>/myBiologyClasses/Evolution/EvolutionImportantNotes.txt
(5) For each of your `.txt` files, click the "Edit" button, add some relevant text,
